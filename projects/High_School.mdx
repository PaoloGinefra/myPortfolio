cardDescription: 'I went to the "Liceo Scientifico Arcangelo Scacchi" in Bari, Italy. I graduated in 2021 with a diploma in scientific studies achieving 100 Cum Laude/100. I''ve chosen a path called Potenziamento Laboratoriale so as to have two additional hours of physics and chemistry laboratory per week in the first two years. The subjects I''ve studied range from mathematics and physics to philosophy, latin and italian litterature giving me solid horizontal fundamentals.'
